I got selected for Google Summer of Code 2019 for a project in The Julia Programming Language under the joint mentorship of [Chris Rackaukas](http://chrisrackauckas.com/), [Samuel Isaacson](http://math.bu.edu/people/isaacson/) and [Yingbo Ma](https://github.com/YingboMa).

My project is under [JuliaDiffEq](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq), titled [Native Julia ODE, SDE, DAE, DDE, and (S)PDE Solvers](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6552298552033280).
